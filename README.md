<h2>:boy: About me: :cat:</h1>
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdrianImiolek, a frontend development enthusiast passionate about creating responsive and user-friendly websites. Iâ€™m continuously learning and improving my skills to build polished and interactive web experiences. </br ></br >
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building modern, responsive websites with a focus on <b>user experience</b> and <b>accessibility</b>. </br ></br >
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <b>React</b> to expand my skills in frontend frameworks and improve my understanding of building dynamic web applications. Iâ€™m also refining my knowledge of <b>vanilla JavaScript</b>, <b>SASS</b>, and <b>BEM</b> for cleaner, more modular code. My goal is to apply these skills to personal projects like my <b>Willow & Oak</b> website and other interactive web experiences.
