<h2>:boy: About me: :cat:</h1>
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdrianImiolek, a frontend development enthusiast passionate about creating responsive and user-friendly websites. Iâ€™m continuously learning and improving my skills to build polished and interactive web experiences. </br ></br >
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building modern, responsive websites with a focus on **user experience** and **accessibility**. Currently, I'm diving deep into **React** and **Vue.js** while exploring **lazy loading** and **scroll reveal animations** for better performance. Iâ€™m also learning game development to expand my skills in interactive experiences. </br ></br >
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **React** to expand my skills in frontend frameworks and improve my understanding of building dynamic web applications. Iâ€™m also refining my knowledge of **vanilla JavaScript**, **SASS**, and **BEM** for cleaner, more modular code. My goal is to apply these skills to personal projects like my **Willow & Oak** website and other interactive web experiences.
